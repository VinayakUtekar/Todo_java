# Todo_java

The Java Web-based Todo application is a versatile project designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently through a web-based interface. This application utilizes JavaServer Pages (JSP) for creating dynamic web pages and SQL for seamless database connectivity and operations. With this web application, users can create, organize, and prioritize their todo lists. Additionally, the application provides the capability to have multiple users with different domains, ensuring personalized task management for each user.

Features:

JavaServer Pages (JSP) for Dynamic Web Pages: The project utilizes JSP, a technology that allows the integration of Java code into HTML, enabling the creation of dynamic web pages. JSP ensures an interactive and user-friendly interface, where users can easily manage their todo lists.

Todo List Management: The web application enables users to create and manage their todo lists. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as complete, update task details, and remove completed tasks. The dynamic web pages ensure a smooth user experience while interacting with the todo list.

Multiple Users with Different Domains: The application includes a user authentication system that allows multiple users to register and log in with unique credentials. Each user has a personalized domain where they can maintain their todo list securely. User-specific todo lists ensure that tasks and progress are private to individual users.

Database Connectivity using SQL: To ensure secure data storage and retrieval, the web application integrates SQL for database connectivity. User data, including todo lists and login information, are stored in the database, providing data persistence and allowing users to access their tasks from any web-enabled device.
